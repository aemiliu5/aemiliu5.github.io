			Hello! I'm <b>Aimilios Seimenis</b>, and I was born in Athens, Greece where I am also studying for my BSc in Games Programming at SAE Athens.

			<br /><br />

			Being a gamer since an early age, I always had a profound curiosity of how games functioned at their core. As a teenager, I liked tinkering with the games I played to understand how they worked under the hood. Since then, a lifelong dream of mine has been to make games myself.

			<br /><br />

			In 2015, I released my first game called Nothing But Space on <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/nothing-but-space/93699">GameJolt</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Aemilius.NothingButSpace">Google Play</a>. Since then, I've designed, programmed, and released nearly twenty games under the "Æmilius" alias, mostly for game jams like Ludum Dare, the Global Game Jam and the Extra Credits Jam, where they've been recognized for their theme interpretations, innovation, and fun factor.

			<br /><br />

			I'm a firm believer that games are an important cultural product and an art form, and I'm interested in working in games in a professional capacity to make that belief a reality through my work.
